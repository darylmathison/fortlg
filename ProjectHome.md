<p>For the Little Guy(ForTLG) is my attempt to provide enterprise software to small businesses in the form of a contact database.<br>
This started as a <a href='http://darylmathison.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/one-for-the-little-guy/'>rant</a>
on my <a href='http://darylmathison.wordpress.com'>blog</a>.</p>

<p>I have several goals of the project listed below:<br>
<blockquote><ol>
<blockquote><li>To give back the open source community where I have gotten so many great tools.  Thank you</li>
<li>An experiment to see if a software system can have two very different operating modes (multi-tier or single-tier) by just changing the configuration.  I also want to see if when in single-tier mode, the system is not so resource demanding it can be run on a modest personal computer<br>
</li>
<li>To show future employers an example of what I am capable of in terms of software development</li>
</blockquote></ol>
